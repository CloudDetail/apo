#### Out-of-the-Box Troubleshooting Workflows

APO comes with a variety of built-in intelligent workflows. You can customize your own workflows with your expertise to enable automated troubleshooting and intelligent operations.  

![Workflows List](./docs/img/workflows-list.png)

APO has integrated expert knowledge into its workflows, with "Alert Events" featuring two deeply integrated workflows: **Alert Validity Analysis** and **Root Cause Analysis**. These workflows automatically analyze alert causes and reduce the workload of alert handling.

![Alert-Events](./docs/img/alert-events.png)

- **Alert Validity Analysis Workflow**: This workflow helps you identify which alerts require immediate attention among numerous notifications. With its assistance, you can quickly focus on critical alerts. Additionally, you can design more sensitive alert rules to gather more context information when incidents occur, which will aid in subsequent troubleshooting.

- **Root Cause Analysis Workflow**: When an alert is received, this workflow automatically retrieves alert context, such as related hosts, services, or pods, searches their metrics and anomalies, and conducts comprehensive root cause analysis using Polaris metrics to help you resolve incidents faster.

All built-in workflows can be modified according to your specific needs and scenarios.

#### Built-in Data Query and Anomaly Detection Tools

Given the abundance of multi-model data in the observability domain, APO provides a suite of data query and anomaly detection tools that everyone can simply drag and drop to use.  

![APO Select Tools](./docs/img/apo-select-tools.png)

#### Result Verifiability

To prevent unverifiable results caused by large model hallucinations, we offer visual data charts during workflow execution. You can view execution results and data charts at every step. Additionally, cross-validation with eBPF Polaris metrics and multi-source metrics further enhances result reliability.

### **LLM-native data plane**
+ **API-centric service map**: APO provides granular visibility into API endpoints within applications, creating clear service dependency maps for specific business flows. Our intelligent similarity algorithms prevent topology sprawl by condensing similar nodes while preserving detailed information in tabular views. Navigate effortlessly between node details with intuitive click-through navigation.
+ **Anomaly events with cross-domain data correlation**: Anomaly events with cross-domain data correlation: Given that observability data is diverse in structure and massive in scale, directly feeding it into large models is impractical. APO‚Äôs innovative approach transforms varied data into anomaly events, correlating them with the service map while capturing essential contextual details. This enriched data stream enables precise anomaly detection and cross-domain correlation, empowering the system to uncover subtle issues and deliver deeper, actionable insights.

### Zero-Touch Tracing Agent Instrumentation
With OneAgent technology, APO supports the automatic instrumentation of multi-language OpenTelemetry agents across traditional and containerized environments, eliminating manual configuration overhead.

### All-in-One Observability Hub
Experience complete visibility with APO's unified platform, bringing together traces, metrics, logs, and events in one cohesive view.
